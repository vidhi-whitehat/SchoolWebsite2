                    <p class="text-muted text-left">Late Mr. Nikunj Lohia laid the foundation of VMPS with a vision to create a bias free and inclusive learning environment. He believed that the core of education is wisdom, insight and responsibility, as knowledge alone cannot decimate darkness. Therefore, at Vidya Mandir, every effort is made to stimulate and unleash the dormant wisdom and potential in our young minds. At VMPS we focus on a learner centered milieu aiming not just towards academic excellence but also towards the richness of humanity, wisdom and compassion. We nurture our students to become life long learners, encouraging and supporting learning that extends beyond classrooms.</p>

                <h4 class="text-capitalize">Our endeavour is to foster the best of Indian values and also cultivate a global outlook in our students. The objective of education is not to cover the mind with a bundle of facts, but to enable it to think creatively, pursue the creation with a sense of curiosity and to enhance oneâ€™s level of curiosity continuously. VMPS equips the children with life skills so that they face the future with confidence and courage. Steps to healthy living, art of getting along with people, balanced approach to life, ability to face challenges and effective communication are some of the finer aspects of life that we instil in our children in their formative years.

With this commitment we adopt best practices and experiment with unconventional techniques to provide education that prepares our students to excel beyond classrooms. We believe in skerrick yet mighty steps.

                    We groom our students into global citizens, who are honest and are always ready to serve mankind. Education for us goes much beyond the education of mind only. Students are just like clay pots that require proper shape and design and we believe that it could be achieved through education, if imparted in a dynamic way.

                    We encourage our students academically and culturally. We groom them in such a way that they become ethically rich. We always motivate them to remain inclined to the cultural richness of the motherland.
